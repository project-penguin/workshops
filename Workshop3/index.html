        <section>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                In this workshop we will be looking at
                <strong>JavaScript.</strong>
                JavaScript helps us create more engaging content for the web!
                Interestingly enough, JavaScript (or "JS" for short!) is the
                most widely used programming language in the world and is the
                3rd major pillar in modern-day web development. You might be
                familiar with the first two! The three of them together are...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why should you care?</h3>
            <p>
                The combination of these three languages working together
                in-sync with one another is what makes today's web-pages what
                they are! You can only get so far writing great HTML and CSS
                without including some JS to make our websites interactive.
            </p>

            <p>
                But before we get into JavaScript, let's do a quick recap on
                what we learnt in the last workshop...
            </p>

            <h3>Recap of Workshop 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We began using semantic and non-semantic elements, and what
                    they mean for the developer
                </li>
                <li>
                    Played around with CSS selectors and classes... remember
                    these?

                    <pre class="html"><code>
&lt;p class="redParagraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</code></pre>

                    <pre class="css"><code>
.redParagraph {
    color: red;
}

</code></pre>
                </li>

                <li>
                    We also began to understand Flexbox using
                    <code>display; flex;</code> in our CSS file to help position
                    content on the page
                </li>
                <li>
                    Created navigation boxes for the homepage of our storefront
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What can JavaScript do?</h2>

            <p>
                JavaScript can help create a captivating and interactive
                experience for the user, as it allows the user to actively
                engage with the website! This helps enhance the experience for
                the user, making it more likely they will either, use our
                website for longer, or come back more often! Some examples of
                this include...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Web Applications e.g. Google Maps - zooming in and dragging
                    your cursor while using Google Maps is all JS in the
                    background!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web Servers and Server Applications. We will learn a little
                    about this when we start using the console!

            <p>
                You should now be in the JavaScript Console! Lets do some coding
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2 - Make a Variable</h2>

            <p>
                A variable is what we use to store things that we want to use in
                our code. For example, we can have a variable called
                <code>price</code> that stores how much money it costs to buy
                something in our store - lets say $50.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong
                    >Type the following JavaScript into the console and press
                    Enter</strong
                >. (You only need to type <code>let price = 50</code>)
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">let price = 50</mark>
&lt; undefined

</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now, '<code>price</code>' holds the value <code>50</code>. You
                can see this by typing <code>price</code> into the console.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; price
&lt; 50

</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now let's give a name to this product that we can show as a
                title on our store - to use words as the value of the variable,
                we use quotation marks (e.g. <code>'words go here'</code>), this
                type of value is called a <strong>string</strong>.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Try the following in the console</strong>.</p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; let title = 'Bread'
&lt; undefined

            <p>
                Now we have a variable called <code>title</code> with the string
                value <code>'Bread'</code>!
            </p>
            <details>

                    <p>
                        Just like we did before with price, we just use the name
                        of the variable to get it's value

            <p>
                That's great, but they're called variables because they can
                'vary', that is, we can change the value of a variable by
                <strong>reassigning</strong> it.

                        There's actually another way of making a variable,
                        instead of using the <code>let</code> keyword, we use
                        <code>const</code>.

                        This might not seem particularly useful, but many
                        programming bugs come from variables changing when we
                        don't expect them to, so it's often nice to 'save us
                        from ourselves' by making sure a variable doesn't
                        change.

                        because it's evil! Bad things happen when you practice
                        in the dark arts of <code>var</code>.

            <h2>Step 3 - Use your variable!</h2>

            <p>
                Now let's make use of these variables by making a popup to show
                them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Popups are shown using the <code>alert()</code>
                <strong>function</strong>. Functions are like variables, but
                instead of holding values, they hold more code!
                <code>alert()</code> has code to show a popup on our website,
                all we have to do is put the string we want it to show in the
                brackets <code>()</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Try it out!</strong> Get <code>alert()</code> to say
                'Hello World', remember that we use quotation marks
                <code>''</code> because it's a string.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; alert('Hello World')
&lt; undefined

</code></pre>

            <details>
                <summary>
                    Bonus: What's this <code>undefined</code> thing?
                </summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Functions like <code>alert()</code> run code, but may
                        also <strong>return</strong> a value. Just like how a
                        variable gives it's <strong>value</strong> when used, a
                        function gives it's <strong>return value</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a function does not have a return value, like in
                        <code>alert()</code>'s case, it's return value is
                        <code>undefined</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the function
                        <code>isFinite()</code> returns whether or not the
                        number you give it is finite, i.e., not infinity.
                    </p>

                    <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; isFinite(10)
&lt; true

</code></pre>
                    <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; isFinite(Infinity)
&lt; false

</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are the
                        <strong>return values</strong> (And just mean yes or
                        no).
                    </p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <p>
                That's pretty cool! We can also add the values of our variables
                to the string that <code>alert()</code> shows.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's show an alert about how much our product costs. We use a
                plus symbol <code>+</code> to add our variables into our string,
                <strong>have a go at the following</strong>.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; alert('The ' + title + ' is $' + price)
&lt; undefined

</code></pre>

            <p>
                It may look a little confusing, but all we're doing is adding
                the value of our variables into the string.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 4 - Objects</h2>
            <p>
                Now, we have our product's display title and price in our two
                variables, but what happens when we want to sell multiple
                products? We could make new variables for each title and price
                of each product, say <code>breadTitle</code> and
                <code>cakeTitle</code>, but this gets messy quick.
            </p>

            <p>
                What if we could group all of our cake-related variables into
                one variable? Well, we can!
            </p>

            <p>
                Using <strong>objects</strong> we can make variables that hold
                multiple values, each with their own name. We make an object
                using curly brackets <code>{}</code> with multiple names and
                values inside. <strong>Have a go at the following</strong>.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
&gt; let cake = {
      title: 'Cake',
      price: 50
  }
&lt; undefined

</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now, we have an <strong>object</strong> variable called
                <code>cake</code> that has the <strong>attributes</strong>
                <code>title</code> and <code>price</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To access these attributes, we use something called
                <strong>dot notation</strong>, using the dot <code>.</code> and
                then the name of the attribute.
                <strong
                    >Try the examples below to use the attributes of

            <pre class="js"><code>

            <p>
                A special variable that can hold more than one value or object
                is called an <strong>array</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can think of it like a container for storing multiple store
                items under a single variable name. We can use it to make our
                code easier to read. For instance, we can name our
                <strong>array</strong> <code>fruits</code>. Inside our 'fruit
                container' we can store different kinds of fruits, like apple,
                banana and strawberry.
            </p>

            <p>
                To declare an array we use the <code>let</code> keyword followed
                by the array's name, for example, <code>products</code>. Then we
                assign the items we want in our array inside square brackets.
            </p>

            <p>Let's add some store items into our products array.</p>

            <p>
                You can customise the 5 products in your store by changing the
                values for <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>,
                <code>image</code>, <code>imageAlt</code> or <code>price</code>.
            </p>
            <p>For example change <b>"Cake"</b> to <b>"Puppies"</b>.</p>
            <pre><code>
{
    title: <strong>"Puppies"</strong>,

            <h4>Adding images</h4>
            <p>Let's make our store a bit more visual by adding images.</p>
            <p>
                See if you can find a cool image on the internet that suits your
                chosen style. Then save it to the <code>images</code> folder in
                your project. It should then appear in your project in VS Code
                on the left under the images folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter the file name (including the file format eg .png) between
                the quotation marks next to <code>image</code> in your chosen
                store item. Ie. <code>image: "cake.png",</code> Make sure you
                also update the <code>imageAlt</code> to reflect the description
                of the image so our store is accessible to screen readers and
                people with visual impairment.

            <h1>Level 3 - Working with Arrays and Functions</h1>
            <p>In this section, we will cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accessing items in an array</li>
                <li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Step 1: Accessing Items in an Array</h2>

            <p>
                In Level 2, we printed a simple message "Hello, World" to our
                console using <code>console.log</code>. We also created an array
                called <b>products</b> in our <code>script.js</code> file. This
                time, let's try logging our entire array to the console.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the script.js file, replace 'Hello World' with the name of
                your array (<b>products</b>), as per the example below. Because
                products is the name of a variable and not a string, you do not
                need to put quotation marks around it.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
console.log(products)
                </code></pre>

            <p class="callout warning">
                IMPORTANT! Double check your script.js file and ensure that this
                line appears BELOW the lines where the products array was
                created.
            </p>

            This is because the code in the script.js file will execute in order
            from top to bottom. If <code>console.log(products)</code> appears
            before the products array is created, then you will get an error as
            it is impossible to log something that has not been created yet.

            <p>
                Next, save your changes and refresh your browser window. When
                you open the JavaScript console as you did in Level 1 Step 1,
                you should see something like the following:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
(5) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                This output indicates that there is an array consisting of five
                objects, and each object contains a number of properties. You
                can expand this output further by clicking on the small triangle
                symbol next to the array, which will allow you to view more
                detail about each individual object in the array. Below is an
                example of what it should look like when you expand it. The
                actual content of each object will depend on what you entered in
                the previous section.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
0: {title: 'Cake', description: 'Tasty cake', image: 'cake.png', imageAlt: 'A blue monster cake', price: 10}
1: {title: 'Milk', description: "Who doesn't like milk", image: 'milk.jpg', imageAlt: 'A woman drinking a tall glass of milk', price: 1}
2: {title: 'Hat', description: 'You want a hat? Here it is.', image: 'hat.jpeg', imageAlt: 'A established fellow wearing a fez', price: 205}
3: {title: 'Crisp High Five', description: 'All the encouragement you could want', image: 'hi5.jpg', imageAlt: 'Dog gives man a solid hi five', price: 3847}
5: {title: 'Milk Again', description: "Who doesn't like milk", image: 'milk.jpg', imageAlt: 'A woman drinking a tall glass of milk', price: 1}
length: 5
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                So what do we do if we want to log only <b>one</b> object from
                the array, and not the whole array?
            </p>

            <p>
                Each item in an array has an "index number" (or "index" for
                short). The index represents an item's position in the array,
                starting from 0 and counting upwards. In the example above, you
                can see that the first object has an index of 0, the second one
                has an index of 1, and so on. This index can be used to retrieve
                a specific object from the array.
            </p>

            <p>
                To do so, change your <code>console.log</code> by adding square
                brackets containing the specific index number of the item you
                want, as follows:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
console.log(products[0]);
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Once you save and refresh your page, the output in the console
                will look something like this (with the content being whatever
                data you entered in Section 2, rather than this example data):
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
{title: 'Cake', description: 'Tasty cake', image: 'cake.png', imageAlt: 'A blue monster cake', price: 10}
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Try logging different items using their index numbers, and see
                if the data that is logged to the console matches what you
                expect!
            </p>

            <p class="callout warning">
                REMEMBER! <br />
                Arrays are zero indexed, which means that the index of the first
                item is always 0, not 1.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Accessing Properties of Objects in an Array</h2>

            <p>
                We've learned how to log our array to the console, and how to
                access individual items of the array and log those as well. But
                what if we don't want to log an entire object, and instead only
                want to log the value of one property, such as "title"?
            </p>

            <p>
                Individual properties of an object can be accessed using
                something called <b>dot notation</b>. We've seen this before in
                Level 1 step 4 of this runsheet, so scroll up and read through
                again if you need to refresh your memory.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can combine the technique we just learned with dot notation
                by selecting the array item we want to access using its index,
                then typing a full stop followed by the name of the specific
                property you want to log after the square brackets.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the example below, we are logging the <b>title</b> property
                of the first item in the <b>products</b> array (remember, the
                first product has an index of 0).
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
console.log(products[0].title);
            </code></pre>

            <p>The console should show the title of your first product:</p>

            <pre class="js"><code>
Cake
            </code></pre>
            <br />
            <details>
                <summary>Bonus: Making Changes</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Now that we have learned how to <b>access</b> the
                        properties of an individual object in an array, what if
                        we want to change a property in some way?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier in this runsheet (Level 1, Step 2), we talked
                        about <b>reassignment</b>. We learned that even if a
                        variable already has a value assigned, we can assign a
                        new value and overwrite the previous one. The same thing
                        will work with properties of objects. <br />
                        Try adding an extra line above your console log, as in
                        the example below:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
products[0].title = "Chocolate Cake"
console.log(products[0].title);
                </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have assigned the value "Chocolate Cake" to
                        the title property of the first object in our array, the
                        output in the console will be:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="js"><code>
Chocolate Cake
                </code></pre>
                </div>
            </details>

            <p>
                Can we use dot notation to access and log the value of the title
                property for EVERY item in the array at once?
            </p>

            <p>
                Not exactly. Try logging <code>products.title</code> without
                specifying an item's index, as below:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
console.log(products.title);
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                You'll find that the output is <code>undefined</code>. In order
                to achieve what we want here, we'll have to use something called
                a "for loop", which will be explained in the next section.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3: "For" Loops</h2>
            <p>
                So far, we have explored the concept of <b>arrays</b>, and have
                seen how to access a single item from an array using its
                <b>index</b>. We've also learned how to access a single property
                of an object using <b>dot notation</b>. If we want to access one
                property of ALL the items in the array and log all of them to
                the console, we can use something called a "for" loop to achieve
                this efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                A loop is something that iterates (repeats over and over again)
                until a condition is met. A "for" loop is a specific kind of
                loop. Try removing any console logs you have remaining in your
                code, and add the code block below your products array:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
for(let i = 0; i &lt; products.length; i++) {
    console.log(products[i].title)
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                If we break this down, the "for" loop in the example above
                essentially says: <br />
                Create a variable called i and set its value to 0. Then:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Check if the value of <code>i</code> is less than the length
                    of the array called <code>products</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it is, access the title property of the object in the
                    <code>products</code> array with an index equal to
                    <code>i</code> and log it to the JavaScript console.
                </li>
                <li>Increment <code>i</code> by one.</li>
                <li>
                    Repeat from step 1 until the value of <code>i</code> is no
                    longer less than the length of the
                    <code>products</code> array, at which point stop.
                </li>
            </ol>

                            loop will execute, otherwise it will stop. In our
                            example, it means that if the value of
                            <code>i</code> is less than the length of the
                            <code>products</code> array (or in other words, less
                            than the number of objects in the aray), the loop
                            should execute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>i++</code> This is a final-expression, which
                            executes at the end of each loop iteration. Normally
                            this is used to add 1 to the counter. In our
                            example, it simply means "increment i by 1".
                        </li>

            <h2>Step 4: Functions</h2>

            <p>
                A function is a block of code designed to perform a task. It
                will not be executed automatically; it needs to be invoked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Functions are useful because they allow us to separate our code
                into segments representing different tasks, and reuse these
                segments in different situations. Let's try turning our "for"
                loop into a function. To do this, we need:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "function" keyword</li>
                <li>A name for our function.</li>
                <li>
                    Normal brackets containing parameters (a parameter
                    represents anything our function needs as input- in this
                    case, it needs an array of products)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Curly brackets to hold the actual code that makes up our
                    function (in this case, our "for" loop)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>First, add the following to your script.js file:</p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
function addProductCard(products) {

}
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                Next, cut and paste your "for" loop so that it is contained
                within the curly brackets of your function, as shown below:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
function addProductCard(products) {
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">    for(let i = 0; i &lt; products.length; i++) {
        console.log(products[i].title)
    }</mark>
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                There's only one thing left to do, which is to invoke your
                function by typing the function name (addProductCard)
                underneath, followed by brackets. Make sure you pass the
                products array to the function by including it in the brackets.
                The completed code is shown below:
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
function addProductCard(products) {
    for(let i = 0; i &lt; products.length; i++) {
        console.log(products[i].title)
    }
}

<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">addProductCard(products);</mark>
            </code></pre>

            <details>
                <summary>Function and Parameter Names</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Functions can be named whatever you want. It's best
                        practice to create a name that describes what your
                        function does, and they should always be written in
                        camelCase (lower case first letter, and after that use
                        an upper case letter to start each new word). Something
                        like "logProductTitles" would be perfect here, but we
                        have used addProductCard instead because we're going to
                        be changing what this function does a little later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parameter names should be all lower case, and should
                        describe the thing you are passing to the function. In
                        this case, we are passing an array of products to our
                        function.

                GREAT JOB! You made it to the end of Level 3! &#129497;
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Level 4 - Display products</h1>
            <p>
                We now have a for-loop where it's going through each item within
                our list of objects. Right now it's only reading out the product
                name so we can tell it's working by reading the console, but we
                can make it display each of these products on our page, along
                with their description/price/image.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 1 - HTML Changes</h2>
            <p>
                For the products to display on the page, we need to make a
                <code>section</code> within our HTML for the products to be in.
                So for this quick change, you need to
                <b>open your index.html file</b> and add in the
                <mark class="highlight">highlighted</mark>
                lines <b>at the bottom</b> of your HTML code.
            </p>
            <pre class="html"><code title="index.html" language="HTML">
      ...
      <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">&lt;section&gt;</mark>
          <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">&lt;h2&gt;Top Products&lt;/h2&gt;</mark>
          <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">&lt;div id="topproductlist" class="itemlist"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</mark>
      <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">&lt;/section&gt;</mark>
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
          </code></pre>
            <p>
                Thats it! you don't have to do anymore HTML code. Once you're
                done with this level, your products will display in this new
                <code>section</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2 - Back to Javascript</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have a <code>div</code> in our HTML for our top
                products list, we need to assign it to a variable in our
                javascript file to use it. We'll be using a new variable we'll
                call <code>topProductsElement</code>, which is the element we
                will be selecting using <code>.getElementById</code>. This just
                means that the <code>div</code> element we made in our HTML
                earlier to contain our top products list is what we'll be using
                here in our javascript. The line of code should be as below, and
                you should put it
                <b>above your code for addProductCard() function, by itself</b>.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
topProductsElement = document.getElementById("topproductlist");
          </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now this next part is a little tricky. We're going to be adding
                our <code>topProductsElement</code> variable as a new input for
                our <code>addProductCard()</code> function.
            </p>
            <p>
                All we need to do is add in an extra word to the brackets of
                <code>addProductCard()</code> (and a comma between them). We
                mention that function twice, so we need to
                <b>make the change to both</b>. The
                <mark class="highlight">highlighting</mark> on the code below
                should show you what we're adding and where.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Don't just copy-paste all the code</b> in the blocks into
                your JS file. Only add the
                <mark class="highlight">highlighted</mark>
                parts to your existing code.
            </p>
            <p>For the addProductCard() function itself:</p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
function addProductCard(<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">parentElement,</mark> products) {
    for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
        console.log(products[i].title)
    }
}
          </code></pre>
            <p>
                For the line of code we added to invoke the function at the end
                of Level 3:
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
        ...
        console.log(products[i].title)
    }
}

addProductCard(<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">topProductsElement,</mark> products);
          </code></pre>
            <p>
                With both mentions of addProductCard() in your code now have two
                inputs, you're ready to move onto building up the function to do
                more.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3 - Completing Our Function</h2>
            <p>
                Make sure you are still <b>in your script.js file</b> in VS
                code. To get started, we're going to add in two lines
                <b>within the for-loop</b> you created in Level 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first line of code uses
                <code>document.createElement</code> so that in each loop (so for
                each product in our list) it will create a <code>div</code> for
                the product and its information. The second line of code uses
                <code>setAttribute</code> to set this <code>div</code> to be an
                <b>"itemcard"</b>
                class, just like how we did ourselves in previous workshops.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
function addProductCard(parentElement, products) {
  for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
      console.log(products[i].title)
      <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">const card = document.createElement("div")</mark>
      <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">card.setAttribute("class", "itemcard")</mark>
  }
}
          </code></pre>

            <p>
                Now that the for-loop is adding in a <code>div</code> for each
                product, we need to start populating those with the product's
                information. To start, we're going to add in the product's
                <b>image</b>. To do this, we're again using
                <code>document.createElement</code> to make an
                <code>img</code> HTML element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two lines of code after that use
                <code>setAttribute</code> to set the <code>src</code> and
                <code>alt</code> attributes like we've done manually before.
                Then finally, the last line appends the image that we have
                defined to the card we made on the page earlier.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
...
const card = document.createElement("div")
card.setAttribute("class", "itemcard")

<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">const image = document.createElement("img")</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">image.setAttribute("src", "images/" + products[i].image)</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">image.setAttribute("alt", products[i].imageAlt)</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">card.append(image)</mark>
...
          </code></pre>

            <p>Next, we're going to add in the product's <b>title</b>.</p>
            <p>
                In our first line of code, we create a <code>h2</code> heading
                HTML element for our product title. In the second line of code,
                we define the <code>innerText</code> of that heading to be the
                same as what we put in the <code>title</code> variable in your
                product's object. The last line makes sure you are actually
                adding the title you've made into the card, the same way we did
                with the image code before.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
...
const image = document.createElement("img")
image.setAttribute("src", "images/" + products[i].image)
image.setAttribute("alt", products[i].imageAlt)
card.append(image)

<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">const title = document.createElement("h2")</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">title.innerText = products[i].title</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">card.append(title)</mark>
...
          </code></pre>

            <p>
                Last but not least, we want to include our <b>price</b> for the
                product as defined in our object list.
            </p>
            <p>
                The execution is similar to the title, only this one will be a
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. Just like before, we create a
                variable for it, add in the information directly from the
                current product object, and then attach the completed price to
                the card.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
...
const title = document.createElement("h2")
title.innerText = products[i].title
card.append(title)

<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">const price = document.createElement("p")</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">price.innerText = "$" + products[i].price</mark>
<mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">card.append(price)</mark>
...
          </code></pre>

            <p>
                The finishing touch is to add a line of code that adds the now
                completed card into the div we opened for it.
            </p>

            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
      ...
      const price = document.createElement("p")
      price.innerText = "$" + products[i].price
      card.append(price)

      <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">parentElement.append(card)</mark>
  }
}
          </code></pre>

            <p>
                If you <b>save your scripts.js code</b> and

            <h2>Horizontal Scroll</h2>
            <p>
                Right now, if we have more than 5 products, the list gets pretty
                squished in the page. One solution to this is allowing our list to
                'overflow' off the page. Once you have the products overflowing,
                the page automatically adds in a scroll bar to allow you to see
                everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll be adding a new class called 'scrollable' which will
                contain all the CSS going forward. First lets make sure our Top
                Products list belongs to this new 'scrollable' class by adding
                in the highlighted word in the HTML like so:
            </p>
            <pre class="html"><code title="index.html" language="HTML">
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Top Products&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div id="topproductlist" class="itemlist <mark style= "background-color: #87c0b650">scrollable</mark>"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now we'll move onto our CSS and define this new class. We'll add
                in <code>overflow-x</code> which allows for horizontal overflow
                on our page like so:
            </p>
            <pre class="css"><code title="style.css" language="CSS">
.scrollable {
    overflow-x: auto;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                However, the horizontal overflow won't work correctly unless we
                state that an <code>itemcard</code> needs to have a minimum
                width. This is because flexbox will by default squish the cards
                to fit the space provided. To fix it we'll add another bit of
                css code as below:
            </p>
            <pre class="css"><code title="style.css" language="CSS">
.scrollable .itemcard{
    min-width: 300px;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                To properly test this, you may need to add more products to your
                current <code>products[]</code> list in your Javascript code.
                Try adding in a bunch more products now that you don't have a
                limit.
            </p>
            <h2>Scroll Styling</h2>
            <p>
                The default scroll bar is a little bland, so to spruce that up
                we can use some more CSS that targets specifically the scroll
                bar within our product list.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 things we'll be changing for the scrollbar. The
                scrollbar itself, the the track of the scrollbar, and the
                draggable scroller (or thumb) that's on the track. We'll be
                adding the three bits of CSS to address these parts with some
                settings that suite our default style. Feel free to tweak the
                values to make it suit your own unique theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add in the CSS below, save your files, and refresh your page to
                see the difference:
            </p>
            <pre class="css"><code title="style.css" language="CSS">
section ::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 20px;
}

section ::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px #c0c0c0;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
section ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px #c0c0c0;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You may have noticed that <code>::-webkit-scrollbar</code> isn't
                like any CSS code we've used before. <code>::</code> denotes a
                'pseudo-element', and <code>web-kit</code> is used for rendering
                content within Safari and Chrome browsers.
            </p>
            <h2>Auto-Scrolling</h2>
            <p>
                Now we're going to get into something a bit more complicated.
                We're going to animate our products list to scroll on its own,
                and when it hits the end of the scroll, we'll make it come back
                to the start.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start, we'll add in a couple variables
                <b>in our Javascript file</b>. We'll add in a variable for the
                amount scrolled creatively called <code>scrollAmount</code>, and
                a variable for whether or not we are scrolling called
                <code>isScrolling</code> which we will have set as true, so that
                automatic scrolling is on by default.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
let scrollAmount = 0;
let isScrolling = true;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This code can be put at the bottom of your file by itself, it
                shouldn't be inside a function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Underneath these 2 statements we'll have a function for the
                animation of the automatic scrolling itself. The code can be
                found below:
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
setInterval(function () {
    const pauseMargin = 100;
    const total = topProductsElement.scrollWidth - topProductsElement.clientWidth + pauseMargin;
    if (isScrolling) {
        scrollAmount = (scrollAmount + 1) % total;
        topProductsElement.scrollLeft = scrollAmount;
    } else {
        scrollAmount = topProductsElement.scrollLeft;
    }
}, 10);
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The logic here might be hard to understand, and that's okay,
                this is the Extensions section. If you're curious, it is
                essentially adding 1 to the <code>scrollAmount</code> to keep
                track of how far it has scrolled across, and uses
                <code>topProductsElement.scrollLeft</code> to go to that spot.
                It uses <i>modulo</i>, or <code>%</code> in code form, to tell if it has
                reached the end, and loops back to the start if it has. The
                <code>pauseMargin</code> is how long it waits before snapping
                you back to the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming your code works, the products list should automatically
                scroll to the right, but what if you're trying to click on a
                product? you'd want it to stop right? To do that we can add in
                some more Javascript code for what the page should do when your
                mouse is hovering over the product list. The code is as below:
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="JS">
topProductsElement.onmouseover = function () {
    isScrolling = false;
};

topProductsElement.onmouseout = function () {
    isScrolling = true;
};
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Make sure this code is placed underneath your statements for
                <code>isScrolling</code> for this to work. What this code does,
                is it sets <code>isScrolling</code> to false when the mouse is
                hovering over our list, and once it isn't hovering over it
                anymore, it goes back to being set to true. This will stop and
                start the animation as desired, otherwise the mouse would stop
                it and the animation would stay off.
            </p>
