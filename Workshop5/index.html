            <h2>Introduction to Workshop 5</h2>
            <p>
                Today we'll be sharing our store products with our friends and
                displaying their products on our sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                You already know the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so
                today we'll be showing you how to use these languages to send
                and receive information from an API (Application Programming
                Interface) which will populate a products list in our store.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a ton of other free APIs available on the web that
                you can use to make your website even cooler!
            </p>

            <h2>What is an API and what cool things can I do with them?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>API</strong> is the acronym for
                <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming
                <strong>I</strong>nterface, which is a piece of software that
                allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are
                everywhere even though you might never see them. Every app and
                website you've used most likely communicates with APIs to do
                things like send instant messages, transfer money online or
                check the weather.
            </p>
            <h3>How does an API work?</h3>
            <p>
                The way an API works is similar to a restaurant. When you sit
                down to eat at a restaurant, you’re given a menu. You select an
                item from the menu and give the waiter your order so they can
                get it from the kitchen. You don't know what happens in the
                kitchen, but after a while the waiter delivers your food to the
                table.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, you are the
                <strong><em>Client</em></strong> acting as your website; your
                order is a <strong><em>request</em> </strong>made to the API in
                a language you both understand; the waiter is the
                <em><strong>API</strong></em
                >; the kitchen is the application or
                <strong><em>server</em> </strong> you are communicating with;
                and the menu is the API <strong><em>documentation</em></strong
                >. You are not allowed to enter the kitchen, and the waiter can
                only deliver what the kitchen provides.
            </p>
            <img
                src="images/API_RESTaurant.png"
                alt="Client communicates to the api which communicates to the server."
            />
            <p>
                The type of order you can give your waiter can also vary, for
                instance you might order drinks, entrée, mains or dessert. But
                it's important to make sure that no matter what you order
                through your waiter, it's in a language you both understand.
            </p>
            <h3>How do we communicate with an API?</h3>
            <p>
                When making an API call over the web, that language is
                <strong>HTTP</strong> or <strong>H</strong>ypertext
                <strong>T</strong>ransfer <strong>P</strong>rotocol, which was
                designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.
                There are a number of HTTP methods which describe the type of
                request, or what you want the API to do. The most commonly used
                ones are:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>GET</code> - I am requesting a piece of information from
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>POST</code> - I am requesting that you create this new
                piece of information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>PUT</code> - I am requesting that you update a piece of
                information that you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>PATCH</code> - I am requesting that you update part of a
                piece of information that you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>DELETE</code> - I am requesting that you delete a piece of
                information that you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this workshop, we'll be using the two most common requests:
                <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        We continued our exploration of JavaScript, and used it
                        to make our store page more functional and interesting
                        by creating elements that responded to clicks.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We created the functionality and styled a dialog
                        (pop-up) so you could pretend to buy one of the products
                        in your store.

            </p>
            <p>
                You will also need to have Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
                installed. If you don't, then we have instructions below on how
                to setup your VS Code environment with the starter code for this
                workshop below.

                    <p>
                        First, if you haven't already, click
                        <a href="../Workshop4/Workshop4.zip">here</a> to
                        download the files from the previous workshop. After
                        they have finished downloading, unzip the files and copy
                        them into a new folder. Make sure to give the new folder
                        a meaningful name, such as My Website or whatever name
                        you would like your project to have.
                    </p>

                    <p class="callout info">
                        To find the zipped files after they are downloaded, open
                        up your File Explorer/Finder and check the 'Downloads'
                        folder. To unzip the entire folder, right click and then
                        select extract all.
                    </p>

                        You will need to open up <code>index.html</code> in your
                        browser. To do this, find the
                        <code>index.html</code> file in the File Explorer/Finder
                        and double click on it. It should open in your default
                        browser.

                    <p class="callout info">
                        From inside VS Code, right click on
                        <code>index.html</code> and select "Reveal in File
                        Explorer/Finder" to quickly navigate to a file.

            <h2>Level 1 - Hands on with APIs</h2>

            <p>
                Now, before we jump straight into using APIs in our code, let's
                try them out ourselves first!
            </p>

            <p>
                Below are some APIs that return <strong>JSON</strong> data when
                you send a <code>GET</code> request. JSON stands for
                <b>J</b>ava<b>S</b>cript <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation. It's a
                simple way for the APIs to send us data, and it's very similar
                to the way you've already made your products list in
                <code>script.js</code>, except that JSON only shows data, not
                code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Familiarise yourself by trying out the following APIs in the API
                Playground! Try editing them in the text box and see what
                happens!
            </p>

            <h2>Level 2 - Setting Up Your Affiliate Section</h2>
            <p>
                What we're going to do is use the power of an API to upload our
                'top products' list for others to use, and be able to download
                one someone else made and display it in our store. But to make
                that work, we need to first do some housekeeping.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Important Code Changes</h3>
            <p>
                When we first created our products display, we assumed all the
                images would be coming from our <code>/images</code> folder. Now
                that we want to use images coming from the internet or our api,
                we'll need to change some of the code we wrote.
            </p>

            <p class="callout warning">
                Warning: your code will not work down the line if you don't make
                these changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, we change all the 'image' variables in our products list
                to
                <b>include</b><code>images/</code
                ><b> before the image file name</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is an example using one of the default values from
                previous workshops, your products may be very different, but
                what you need to add will be the same.
            </p>
            <div class="snippetresult">
                <h3>Before</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
{
  title: "Cake",
  description: "Tasty cake",
  image: "cake.png",
  imageAlt: "A blue monster cake",
  price: 10,
},
                </code></pre>
                <h3>After</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
{
  title: "Cake",
  description: "Tasty cake",
  image: "<mark style = "background-color: #87c0b670" >images/</mark>cake.png",
  imageAlt: "A blue monster cake",
  price: 10
},
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You need to do this for <b>every product in your list</b>.</p>
            <p>
                The second little change we need is to remove the addition of
                <code>images/</code> we did within the
                <code>addProductCard()</code> function like so:
            </p>
            <div class="snippetresult">
                <h3>Before</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
function addProductCard(parentElement, products) {
  for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    console.log(products[i].title);
    const card = document.createElement("div");
    card.setAttribute("class", "itemcard");

    const image = document.createElement("img");
    image.setAttribute("src", <mark style = "background-color: #ff4d4d70" >"images/" +</mark> products[i].image);
    image.setAttribute("alt", products[i].imageAlt);
    card.append(image);
                </code></pre>
                <h3>After</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
function addProductCard(parentElement, products) {
  for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    console.log(products[i].title);
    const card = document.createElement("div");
    card.setAttribute("class", "itemcard");

    const image = document.createElement("img");
    image.setAttribute("src", products[i].image);
    image.setAttribute("alt", products[i].imageAlt);
    card.append(image);
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Similarly, the last change we need is to remove the addition of
                <code>images/</code> we did within the
                <code>populateDialog()</code> function like so:
            </p>
            <div class="snippetresult">
                <h3>Before</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
function populateDialog(product) {
  const title = document.getElementById("dialogtitle");
  const description = document.getElementById("dialogdescription");
  const image = document.getElementById("dialogimage");
  const price = document.getElementById("dialogprice");
  const buyButton = document.getElementById("buybutton");
    
  title.innerText = product.title;
  description.innerText = product.description;
  price.innerText = "$" + product.price;
  image.src = <mark style = "background-color: #ff4d4d70">"images/" +</mark> product.image;
  image.alt = product.imageAlt;
    
  buyButton.onclick = buyThing(product);
}
                </code></pre>
                <h3>After</h3>
                <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
function populateDialog(product) {
  const title = document.getElementById("dialogtitle");
  const description = document.getElementById("dialogdescription");
  const image = document.getElementById("dialogimage");
  const price = document.getElementById("dialogprice");
  const buyButton = document.getElementById("buybutton");

  title.innerText = product.title;
  description.innerText = product.description;
  price.innerText = "$" + product.price;
  image.src = product.image;
  image.alt = product.imageAlt;
    
  buyButton.onclick = buyThing(product);
}
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                That's it. Your functions are now able to be reused for our
                upcoming API functionality!
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2: Additional HTML</h3>
            <p>
                As the title of this step might suggest, we'll be working on our
                HTML file for this bit (<code>index.html</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Much like we did when making room for our top products list, we
                need to have a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for our API products
                list to be in. You can put it just below your Top Products like
                this:
            </p>
            <pre class="html"><code title="index.html" language="html">
...
&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Top Products&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div id="topproductlist" class="itemlist"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

<mark class = "highlight">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Other Products&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div id="otherproductlist" class="itemlist"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</mark>
...
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Step 3: Back to JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                In your <code>script.js</code> code, add these two lines at the
                bottom of the file.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
...
<mark class = "highlight">const otherProductsListElement = document.getElementById("otherproductlist");</mark>

<mark class = "highlight">const API_URL = "https://workshop5api.vercel.app/api/products/";</mark>
<mark class = "highlight">const PRODUCT_ID = "631712785011ab51ce90c614";</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The first line adds the 'otherproductlist' you made in the HTML
                as a variable we can reference in our JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second line about <code>API_URL</code> is the URL to the API
                we will be using for both our GET and POST requests.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our third line of code, we have the <code>PRODUCT_ID</code>,
                which we will be using in our GET request to get the default
                product list. More on this later.
            </p>
            <p class="callout warning">
                Don't forget to save your HTML/JS files and refresh your browser
                each time you edit your code for changes to take effect
            </p>
            <p class="callout success">
                Nicely done. Now let's get to the fun part! &#9193;

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Level 3 - Our GET Request</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you have the two variables we'll be working with, we
                can move onto some new functions. First, we'll make a function
                that sends a GET request to our API. GET requests tell an API to
                give us information. In our case, we'll be requesting a list of
                products to fill in our new
                <code>otherProductList</code> section.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function getAPIProducts(id) {

}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You may have noticed that this function is defined as
                <code>async</code>. This is short for <b>Asynchronous</b>. You
                don't need to fully understand this, but async functions have
                one or many <code>await</code> statements in them. Essentially
                <code>await</code> makes our code wait for a result before
                moving on. The result in our case is an answer from our API. Our
                function also takes 'id' as input. This ID will tell our API
                what list of products you want to actually get.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside this new <code>getAPIProducts()</code>function we'll have
                a line for using <code>fetch()</code> to perform our GET
                request, a line for assigning the resulting JSON response to a
                variable we'll call 'data', and a final line to return this data
                when the function is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>fetch()</code> request contains a 'method' which
                states this request will be a GET request. We'll also be giving
                it the API URL, and the ID of the product list we want.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function getAPIProducts(id) {
  <mark class="highlight">const response = await fetch(API_URL + id, {</mark>
    <mark class="highlight">method: "GET",</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">});</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">const data = await response.json();</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">return data;</mark>
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Having a function that gets our new list of products from the
                API is one thing, but we still need to properly process and add
                this data into our website. The code for this will be stored in
                another new async function that we'll call
                <code>setProducts()</code>
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function setProducts() {

}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Inside this new function we'll add a few lines of code. The
                first line calls <code>getAPIProducts()</code> which we made
                earlier, and gives it the ID that will return the default list
                of products to test that this works.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The second line of code in this function calls our
                <code>addProductCard()</code> function we edited earlier to get
                it to add our list of products into the page in the right spot
                (otherProductListElement).
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function setProducts() {
  <mark class="highlight">const response = await getAPIProducts(PRODUCT_ID);</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">addProductCard(otherProductsListElement, response.data.products);</mark>
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                In order for us to see our new products list populated
                automatically, we need to send our GET request when we first
                load the website. To do this, we simply add a call to our
                <code>setProducts()</code> function within our JavaScript file
                by adding <b>this one line</b> in underneath our function:
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
  ...
  addProductCard(otherProductsListElement, products);
}

<mark class="highlight">setProducts()</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                That's all for the GET request. These functions should now be
                running automatically when loading your page, so to test that
                this works, all you need to do is save your JavaScript and HTML
                files and reload your browser tab. If it all went well, you
                should see the default products we've stored in the API and it
                should look like this:
            </p>
            <img
                src="images/defaultOtherProducts.PNG"
                alt="Starting LiveServer"
                style="max-width: 100%"
            />
            <p class="callout success">
                Your GET request is complete! Now its time for POST &#128238;
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Level 4 - Our POST Request</h2>
            <p>
                Since we already did a lot of the background work for our POST
                request, all we need is another async function that sends our
                product list up to the API. We'll call this function
                <code>saveAPIProducts</code>
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function saveAPIProducts() {

}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                First, we'll add in our <code>fetch()</code> request. Inside the
                request we have to state that our method will be POST, and that
                the 'body' or data in the request will be a JSON conversion of
                our <code>products</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The
                <code>headers</code> section is used for authentication among
                other things. In our case, the API is expecting a secret code
                before it lets us upload stuff. This is to prevent the API
                getting unwanted traffic. We need to replace the
                <code>"REPLACE_ME"</code> string with the real auth.
                <b
                    >To get the secret code, either ask a facilitator, or get it
                    from a friend who already has it</b
                >.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function saveAPIProducts() {
  <mark class="highlight">const formattedProducts = await formatRequestImages(products);</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">const response = await fetch(API_URL, {</mark>
    <mark class="highlight">method: "POST",</mark>
    <mark class="highlight">body: JSON.stringify({ products: formattedProducts }),</mark>
    <mark class="highlight">headers: {</mark>
      <mark class="highlight">auth: "REPLACE_ME",</mark>
      <mark class="highlight">"Content-type": "application/json"</mark>
    <mark class="highlight">}</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">});</mark>
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                After the API request we need to still await the response. Even
                when using POST, you will get a response to let you know whether
                or not the request was successful. Much like with the GET
                request, we'll assign that JSON response to a variable called
                <code>data</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The API in our case returns the ID that your product list will
                be stored under. We'll use <code>console.log()</code> to display
                this within the developer console.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
async function saveAPIProducts() {
  const formattedProducts = await formatRequestImages(products);
  const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ products: formattedProducts }),
    headers: {
      auth: "REPLACE_ME",
      "Content-type": "application/json"
    }
  });

  <mark class="highlight">const data = await response.json();</mark>
  <mark class="highlight">console.log("Your ID is: " + data.id);</mark>
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                We're going to pop in some magic code to handle all the image
                related activity. You don't need to understand this code at all,
                but having this code is necessary for us to be able to send
                images to our API for other people to get.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can put this at the bottom of your JavaScript file, but
                <b>you should not edit it</b>.
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
//!! MAGIC CODE NO TOUCHY !!//
function toDataURL(e){return fetch(e).then((n=>"cors"===n.type?e:n.blob()))
.then((e=>new Promise(((n,t)=>{if("string"==typeof e)return n(e);
const o=new FileReader;o.onloadend=()=>n(o.result),o.onerror=t,o.readAsDataURL(e)}))))}
async function formatRequestImages(e){return"file://"===document.location.origin?(
console.log("Webpage is running from file, unable to format images"),e)
:await Promise.all(e.map((e=>new Promise((n=>{toDataURL(e.image).then((t=>n({...e,image:t})))
.catch((()=>{n(e)}))})))))}
//!! END OF MAGIC CODE !!//
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                When all your code is together, remember to
                <b>save your code and refresh your browser</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the GET request from earlier, our POST request is not
                automatic. When you are ready to upload your list of products,
                you can go into the developer console and simply type
                <code>saveAPIProducts()</code> and press enter. If it was
                successful, it should look something like this:
            </p>
            <img
                src="images/saveAPIProducts().PNG"
                alt="Starting LiveServer"
                style="max-width: 50%"
            />
            <p class="callout info">
                Shortcuts for Developer Console: Option + Command + J (on
                macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux)

            <p class="callout warning">
                The API has a request size limit of 4.5MB, so try to make sure your images and text combined aren't too big. If you need to reduce the size of an image file, you can use this easy tool called <a href="https://squoosh.app/" target="blank">Squoosh</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Note: 'cake.png' from previous workshops was originally too large. If you have this version of the image, you can use Sqoosh.app linked above. Remember to check the filename and extension are the same as in your code</i>
            </p>

            <h3>Sharing Your Product List</h3>
            <p>
                If your POST request is working correctly, you should see an ID
                displayed in your developer console. If you remember back to our
                GET function, we're currently using the default ID to get a set
                of products we left in the API for your testing purposes.
                However, since we know the ID of a product list that has been
                uploaded by us (or by a friend), we can change the ID in our GET
                function to download a different product list!
            </p>
            <p>
                All you need to do is change this highlighted ID in your JS code
                to the ID of a product list uploaded by someone else:
            </p>
            <pre class="js"><code title="script.js" language="js">
const PRODUCT_ID = "<mark>631712785011ab51ce90c614</mark>";

            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You can test this out using your own ID that turns up on your
                console, or by getting an ID from a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may notice that images aren't working correctly if your
                products are using image files from your
                <code>/images</code> folder. Don't worry, we'll be fixing this
                in the next step.
            </p>
            <p class="callout success">
                That's it, your requests are done! You now know how to use an
                API &#129302;

            <h2>Level 5 - Going Live</h2>
            <p>
                As it is now, images will only work in your uploaded products
                list if you were using URLs. Image files on your own computer
                don't work properly because your website (and your images
                folder) aren't being hosted as a server yet. There's an easy fix
                for this in VS Code - the Live Server extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Live Server, we should be able to host our website, have
                the image files work properly, and even have other people in the
                same network connect to your website!
            </p>
            <h3>Installing Live Server</h3>
            <p>
                To be able to send photos to the API via a POST request, we'll
                have to install the Live Server extension on VS Code. Use
                <b>Ctrl + Shift + P</b> on Windows or
                <b>Command + Shift + P</b> on MacOS to bring up the Command
                Palette. In the search bar that pops up at the top, type: <br />
                <code>ext install ritwickdey.LiveServer</code>
            </p>
            <img
                src="images/Installing_LiveServer.PNG"
                alt="Installing LiveServer extension"
            />
            <p>
                Press Enter/Return to run the command. Once the extension has
                installed, head back to the Explorer tab on the top left of the
                screen to view your files again. Right click on
                <code>index.html</code> and select
                <b> Open with Live Server</b>.
            </p>
            <img
                src="images/Starting_LiveServer.PNG"
                alt="Starting LiveServer"
                style="max-width: 50%"
            />
            <p>
                This will open up your website on a new page using a development
                server! You will now be able to send photos to the API by typing
                <code>saveAPIProducts()</code> in the console.
            </p>
            <p class="callout success">
                That's it, your website is finished! Or at least the runsheet
                content is. You can always continue to improve your shop.
